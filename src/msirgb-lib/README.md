 MSIRGB is an alternative to MSI Mystic Light for controlling motherboard LEDs & 5050? LED strips. Unlike Mystic Light, there is no limitation to 7 fixed colours.
 
 Aside from providing a GUI for quickly experimenting with different basic effects, it also provides a scripting interface to create more advanced effects like [this one](#example-effects) and to auto-run these effects on Windows startup.
 
 Many thanks to [nagisa/msi-rgb](https://github.com/nagisa/msi-rgb) which helped me start this project.
 
 **NOTE: MSIRGB is in bug-fix only-mode. No new features will be added, so don't bother asking. Lua scripts already allow you to do whatever you might feel like doing, within the boundaries set by hardware limitations.**
 
 # How to use
  1. Check if your motherboard is supported [here](#motherboard-support). If it is, you may proceed. If it isn't, it's possible the program won't work with your motherboard. Other MSI motherboards may be supported despite not being listed. Non-MSI motherboards are not supported and MSIRGB will not run on those. [I provide no warranty should your motherboard malfunction.](#license)
  1. Make sure you're running a 64-bit release of Windows 10.
  2. Make sure you don't have any anti-cheat enabled. Riot Vanguard and FACEIT Anti-Cheat are known to block MSIRGB from running.
  1. Follow the instructions [here](#how-to-install) to download & install MSIRGB.

# How it works
![MSIRGB](media/gui.PNG)

When you run MSIRGB, you will see this GUI. Here you can experiment with simple effects by changing hardware-implemented settings in your motherboard.

- **Colours**: You can choose to change between 8 different colours. The order by which the motherboard switches between them is from left to right, and then right to left, as displayed. You can choose from 4096 different colours (4 bits per channel, hardware limited).

- **Step duration**: This is the interval of time between each change of colour. Possible values are 0 to 511, inclusive.

- **Breathing mode**: This is one of the two flashing modes supported by all the motherboards that MSIRGB targets. Breathing mode flashes from on to off and back again by gradually changing brightness. The speed of this effect cannot be changed.

- **Flashing mode**: This other flashing mode flashes from on to off and back again instantly, and the speed of the effect can be changed to different preset values.

- **Scripts**: Scripts allow you to leverage these hardware-implemented functions to create more advanced effects. While the functionality provided by the motherboard seems minimal, you can create some interesting effects with them. Currently MSIRGB has a few example effects you can download and try: the [hue wheel effect](#example-effects), the strobe effect, the police lights effect, the heartbeat effect and the pumpkin effect. New effects are always welcome. Feel free to open a pull request if you'd like to contribute (I apologise in advance for being so nitpicky about code quality).

# How to install
 1. Install [VC Redist 2019 x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
 2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ixjf/MSIRGB/releases/download/v2.3.0/MSIRGB-v2.3.0.zip).
 3. Download the [latest example effects](https://github.com/ixjf/MSIRGB/releases/download/scripts-v2.2.0/MSIRGB-Scripts.7z).
 4. Unpack the archive from 3. into any folder, then create a "Scripts" folder in that same directory and unpack the archive from 4. there, such that your directory structure is like this:
    - Scripts/
        - Hue Wheel.lua
        - ...
    - ...
    - MSIRGB.exe
 5. Run MSIRGB.exe. It'll ask you for administrator privileges. This is required to access the hardware.

# Motherboard support
 *This is not an exhaustive list of all motherboards supported by MSIRGB. There may be others not listed here that also work. It may also be the case that some of these aren't actually supported. Running MSIRGB on an unsupported motherboard and ignoring the warning message on startup may lead to damage to your data or the motherboard. Do it at your own risk.*
